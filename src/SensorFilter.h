 Usage for SensorFilter_Median
 
 SensorFilter_Median MyMedian(x,y);  // where x = number of elements e.g. 9 and y the index which will be used e.g. 5
 newvalue = MyMedian.NewMedian(z);   // where z is the new value to be added to the sorted array to determine the median - new median is returned by the function

 Usage for SensorFilter_Average

 SensorFilter_Average myAverage(x);  // where x = number of elements over which average will be calculated
 newvalue = myAverage.NewAverage(y); // where y is the new number to be added to the array on which average will be based - new average is returned by the function
